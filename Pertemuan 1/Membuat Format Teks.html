<p><h2 align="center">Bulbasaur (Pokemon)</h2></p>
<b>Bulbasaur</b> is a small, quadrupedal amphibian <b><u>Pokemon</u></b>. <br/><i>It has blue-green skin with
darker patches, red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt
snout with a wide mouth.</i> A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is
open. Each of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb, which is
grown from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines and provides
it with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
